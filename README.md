# Thoughts

14th of May 2023:
- So finally i decided to switch to github pages instead of my profile page to show my thoughts to people
- Due to my inexperience with Frontend development I decided to just write plain markdown but i am planning to switch to Jekyll instead soon
- God I wish there was a much faster way to deploy these

# Random 
- QuteBrowser is not that good
- Emacs > Vim. Vim users has an unnecesary supeority complex
- Nix > Ay Other package manager
- NIxOS is the best distro
- I USE NixOS FYI
- NSA Good Luck! ;)
- Also luck to you
- Paranoiaâ„¢
- Stallman Was Right All Along. We just ignored him and now in this day we are paying the consuquence of our ignorance
- Dont see my face please
