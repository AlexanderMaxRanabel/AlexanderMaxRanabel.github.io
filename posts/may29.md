I am planning to start a full directory on this blog thats supposed be links to people i like and their content so essentially making this place a collective blog.
I will manually add links to github profiles and blogs(if they have) to a directory. In future i want people to contrubite through pull requests for blog content.

I think I got a name for this project: Xvaba.
I will create the directory in a few minutes after this update is released
